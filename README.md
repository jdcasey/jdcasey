I'm a software architect / engineer with Red Hat, specializing in very large build systems (and especially content management in those systems). I'm a long-time Java developer who's reasonably dangerous in Python and a few other programming languages.

I've got a couple 3D printers and I'm a whole other level of dangerous with a soldering iron. I just generally love to modify the world around me.

I've been learning Chinese since 2018 (but that's a long road!) and Spanish for the last year or so.
